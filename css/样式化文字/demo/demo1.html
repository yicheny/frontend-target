        Makes the text spread out, varying the gaps in between the words so that all lines of text are the same width. You need
        to use this carefully — it can look terrible, especially when applied to a paragraph with lots of long words in it. If
        you are going to use this, you should also think about using something else along with it, such as hyphens, to break
        some of the longer words across lines.
